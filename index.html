							<h2><strong>About me</strong></h2>
						</header>
						<p>Driven by the belief that exceeding one's perceived limitations unlocks true potential, I've always found myself motivated to chase my dreams. In the pursuit of many, my journey has led me to discover a profound interest in data exploration and analytics. I’ve thrived through diverse experiences, including interning as a Data Analyst at Thorogood Associates and as a Business Analyst at Merilytics. I also worked as a Digital Marketing Business Analyst at India’s largest food delivery platform, Zomato.</p>
						<p>These roles have given me a strong foundation in data analysis, problem-solving, and strategic decision-making. With the experience I withhold, I am keen about delving deeper into the field of Data Science and am actively seeking opportunities to grow further in this space. </p>

							<h2 align = "center">More about me!</h2>
							<p>It all started with a project under the mentorship of Dr. Arnab Dutta and Dr. Debirupa Mitra that I was introduced to machine learning. Together, we crafted a classification model, achieving a 98% accuracy in classifying anti-biofilm peptides. The model is also justified using a coalitional game theory method of shapely analysis and a paper was also published in <link> Digital Chemical Engineering </link>. Witnessing the potential of data, and its ability to reveal hidden patterns ignited a passion within me. Hence, I've started exploring applications of data through my internships and job.</p>
							<p>In my final year of undergraduate studies, I interned at Thorogood Associates as a Data Analyst, where I tackled the challenge of reaching potential clients by building an ETL pipeline using Python, SQL, and Azure Cloud resources. This project resulted in a Power BI dashboard that helped the marketing team track LinkedIn interactions and refine post parameters for more effective client targeting. Inspired by the impact of data-driven decisions, I joined Merilytics as a Business Analyst intern, where I developed an automated model to assist a client with quarterly revenue forecasts, providing critical business insights. These experiences laid the foundation for my full-time role at Zomato as a Marketing Business Analyst, where I continued to leverage data for strategic marketing solutions.</p>
							<p>At Zomato, my role extended beyond the typical responsibilities of a Digital Marketing Business Analyst. I was actively involved in product growth, marketing P&L management, and partner co-branding initiatives. One of my key contributions was strategizing new user acquisition and retention to enhance the quality of first-time users on the platform. I conducted in-depth analyses of new user behaviors to identify fake accounts and cohort true new users based on their downstream behavior over a year. Using these cohorts, a model was developed to predict the one-year net margin each user would bring to the platform, guiding product changes and marketing strategies to attract high-margin users. This approach significantly improved the quality and retention of new users, driving a substantial impact on both product and marketing teams.</p>
							<p>Additionally, I leveraged Google’s ADH to extract insights on campaign performance and efficiency, applying these findings to enhance targeting and achieve cost savings. I also had the opportunity to work with Meta’s beta Advanced Analytics tool, which provided deeper understanding of Meta campaign performance. Attending a Meta Marketers Meet introduced me to Meta’s open-source Marketing Mix Modeling tool, Robyn, which fueled my passion for data science and its applications in marketing. This passion led me to pursue further education in Data Science at George Washington University, where I continue to expand my expertise in leveraging data-driven insights for impactful business decisions.</p>
							<p>My role in Zomato has given me much more motivation and enthusiasm to pursue my career track in Data Science and its applications. With the experience I withhold, I am keen about delving deeper into the field of Data Science and am actively seeking opportunities to grow further in this space.</p>
